# VRP Gunshop

Hello everyone, I am releasing an updated gun shop for [vRP](https://github.com/DunkoUK/dunko_vrp) which is fully customizable!

Features:
* Fully customizable with a config file
* Works perfectly with OneSync & OneSync Infinity
* Everything you need for a Gunshop
* You can make it so only certain groups can buy weapons

Notes:
* This is only limited to the vRP framework, an ESX version will be coming out very shortly and will be linked underneath this thread.
* You can make/edit where the Gunshops are located within the `cfg/config.lua` file.

How to install:
1. Ensure you have the RageUI resource started before the menu.
2. Download my forked version of [RageUI](https://github.com/bxrksggs/RageUI).
3. Download my repo of the gun shop [here](https://github.com/bxrksggs/vrp_gunshop).
4. Copy vrp_gunshop into your resources folder.
5. Copy RageUI into your resources folder.
6. Start your two resources & have fun!
